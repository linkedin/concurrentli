# Concurrentli

Concurrentli (com.concurrentli) is a collection of classes for multithreading that have proven useful at LinkedIn that expand
on java.util.concurrent, adding convenience, efficiency and new tools to multithreaded Java programs.

## New Locks, Semaphores and Signals
- FutureEpochEvent and ImminentEpochEvent allow the caller to wait for a particular epoch (a long) or higher to be set.
- ResettableEvent is inspired by C#'s AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent classes, providing a simple way to wait for
an event to be "set" with or without automatic resetting of the event.
- SemaphoreMap associates semaphores with keys, storing only those semaphores that currently have available permits or
waiting threads.

## New Queues and Buffers
- SequentialQueue assigns queued items a sequentially-increasing index the corresponds with the order they will be
dequeued while allowing for random-access enqueing of future items.
- UnsafeCircularIntegerBuffer and UnsafeCircularReferenceBuffer are high-performance, thread-safe circular (ring)
buffers.

## ParallelProcessor
ParallelProcessor simplifies a common concurrency scenario where a single-threaded reader thread produces inputs (e.g.
by reading a stream) which are then processed by many threads.  ParallelProcessor provides an abstract class that
handles the multithreading, synchronization, and returning of processed elements in the order in which they were read;
all client code needs to do is implement the nextInput() and processInput() methods.

## Efficiency
- AtomicWriteOnceReference provides cheap, lock- and synchronization-free (but still thread-safe) access to a value that
is set only once (the naive alternative, reading directly from a volatile, requires a memory fence on each read).
- Singleton similarly provides cheap, lock- and synchronization-free (but still thread-safe) access to a value that is
generated only once using a provided getValue() method.  This is a cheaper alternative to standard double-checked
locking (correct implementations of which will read a volatile on each access).
- ExclusiveIdempotentMethod provides a nonblocking, lock-free way to ensure that exactly one thread is exclusively
running a particular method when tryRun() is called.

## Convenience
- Interrupted is a utility class that wraps methods throwing InterruptedException, either ignoring the error
(appropriate for the top-level method in a thread, which will thus terminate when the method returns) or re-throwing it
as an unchecked UncheckedInterruptedException.

## Managed Blockers
Implementations of `ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker` for reading streams (`ManagedStreamReadBlocker`), acquiring locks
(`ManagedLockBlocker`), dequeueing (`ManagedDequeueBlocker`), and combining multiple blockers (`ManagedMultiBlocker`).
