/**
 * Queue where items are dequeued in a fixed, sequential order, starting with item 0, then 1, then 2, etc.
 * Items are enqueued together with their index; the queue has a bounded capacity for future items, so enqueueing items
 * will not block so long as they are not too far in the future (beyond the capacity of the queue).
 *
 * For example, if we create the queue with a capacity of 10, the next item is initially 0.  If we try to insert an
 * item with index 10 at this point, the insertion will block until the first item (at index 0) is dequeued, because
 * only then will the queue have a slot to accommodate the inserted value.  Conversely, inserting a value at index 9
 * would not block, because there's already a slot available for it.
 *
 * This class is an efficient way to obtain the results of parallel computation in a predetermined order.  For example,
 * a parallel compression utility that compressed blocks of input in parallel threads could put each compressed
 * block into a {@link SequentialQueue} while another thread wrote them to an underlying stream in their proper order.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of item stored in this queue
