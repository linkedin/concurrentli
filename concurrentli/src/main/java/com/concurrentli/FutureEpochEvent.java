/**
 * Allows threads to wait for an "epoch" to occur.  Once an epoch is set(), all threads
 * waiting for that epoch or a lower-valued ("earlier") epoch will be awoken.  A thread attempting to await an epoch
 * that has already occurred will return immediately.
 *
 * Epochs are monotonically increasing; they never go down and start at 0 by default; this rule avoids
 * race conditions where two threads try to set different epochs, as the ultimate result will be the same as if only
 * the set(...) call with the higher epoch value was made.
 *
 * {@link FutureEpochEvent} is intended to be used when the epochs being awaited are sparse and far in the future.
 * If you typically wait for epochs that will occur in the near future, {@link ImminentEpochEvent} may be more
 * efficient.
