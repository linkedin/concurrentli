/**
 * There are cases where a block of code must execute exclusively, but additional (exclusive) executions are harmless
 * and the thread running it is immaterial.  {@link ExclusiveIdempotentMethod} handles this situation by wrapping an
 * idempotent (extra executions are harmless) method and protecting its exclusivity in a lock-less, no-waiting
 * fashion.
 *
 * (1) If the current thread wants to execute the method and it is not currently running, that thread starts running the
 *     method.
 * (2) If another thread is already executing the method, that thread will run it at least one more time, and the
 *     current thread will immediately return.
 *
 * {@link ExclusiveIdempotentMethod} is particularly useful in lock-free concurrent programming when a method must run
 * exclusively to update shared data structures (e.g. in response to some event).  For example, if multiple threads are
 * writing elements to a circular buffer, after each write we can check to see if the first element is non-null and, if
 * so, perform work on the elements in sequential index order, using a method like:
 *
 * while((elem = circBuff.get(circBuff.getFirstElementIndex()) != null) {
 *   circBuff.advance();
 *   consumeSequentialElement(elem);
 * }
 *
 * If this method is wrapped by this class and tryRun() is invoked after every write to the circular buffer, correct
 * behavior (calling consumeSequentialElement on elements in sequentially increasing order of index) is guaranteed.
 * However, calling the method directly would result in incorrect behavior, since multiple threads could be executing
 * the loop at once.
