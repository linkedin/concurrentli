/**
 * Allows threads to wait for an "epoch" to occur.  Once an epoch is set(), all threads
 * waiting for that epoch or a lower-valued ("earlier") epoch will be awoken.  A thread attempting to await an epoch
 * that has already occurred will return immediately.
 *
 * Epochs are monotonically increasing; they never go down and start at 0 by default; this rule avoids
 * race conditions where two threads try to set different epochs, as the ultimate result will be the same as if only
 * the set(...) call with the higher epoch value was made.
 *
 * {@link ImminentEpochEvent} is intended to be used when the epochs being awaited are in the near future, within a
 * known, fixed horizon, and fairly contiguous distribution (e.g. waiting for 3, 4, 5, 6, not 4, 19, 30).
 * {@link FutureEpochEvent} may be more efficient if you regularly await epochs farther in the future.
